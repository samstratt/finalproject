      <h1>Meet the Owners</h1>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/logan-normal.png" alt="Logan Cates" title="Logan Cates"/>

        <h2>Logan Cates</h2>

        <p>Founding member, former podcast co-host and expectant father. Logan prides himself on putting in the man hours of fantasy football, constantly looking through stats, scrolling through twitter, and glued to the screen on Sundays. Logan is one of the top regular season performers with an all-time record of 22-11. But much like his favorite player Lamar Jackson, post-season success has eluded him. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/hunter-normal.png" alt="Hunter Creamer" title="Hunter Creamer"/>

        <h2>Hunter Creamer</h2>

        <p>Founding member and tall guy. While Hunter may physically be a very imposing figure, he is no more threatening than a small kitten within the realm of fantasy football. With very little experience when the league was founded, Hunter is starting to figure things out. This year he looks to make the playoffs and make a push for the championship.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/brayson-normal.png" alt="Brayson Farmer" title="Brayson Farmer"/>

        <h2>Brayson Farmer</h2>

        <p>Founding member and inaugural champion. Though he moved away shortly after winning his championship, Brayson has stayed well connected and active within the league. Hopefully we are lucky enough for him to grace us with his presence at the year’s draft. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/hayden-normal.png" alt="Hayden Hughes" title="Hayden Hughes"/>

        <h2>Hayden Hughes</h2>

        <p>Founding member, commissioner, trading guru and podcast host. Hayden wears many hats, but sadly, he wears no rings. Usually one of the top teams in the league, he looks to finally put it all together this season. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/davis-normal.png" alt="Davis Mendes" title="Davis Mendes"/>

        <h2>Davis Mendes</h2>

        <p>Founding member and a proud #GirlDad. Davis likes to wheel and deal between trades and the waiver wire, perhaps to a fault. Davis has struggled to perform with an all-time record of 11-22 but is no slouch. Look for Davis to bounce back in a big way this season.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/jaime-normal.png" alt="Jaime Ortega" title="Jaime Ortega"/>

        <h2>Jaime Ortega</h2>

        <p>Member as of 2019. Jaime has been nothing more than and afterthought or a punchline when it comes to fantasy football. Whether it be questionable trades or insane lineup decisions, Jaime never ceases to amaze with his unwavering confidence. The bright side? Jaime has no where to go but up.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/ed-normal.png" alt="Eddie Ramos" title="Eddie Ramos"/>

        <h2>Eddie Ramos</h2>

        <p>Member as of 2020. Eddie performed better than most rookies, making the playoffs in his first year. He may be new to the league, but he has been around it for years as he is good friends with multiple members. The learning curve will not be as steep for Eddie as he looks to seriously contend this season.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/patrick-normal.png" alt="Patrick Scott"/>

        <h2>Patrick Scott</h2>

        <p>Founding member and podcast host. Patrick has helped the league become what it is today with his unmatched enthusiasm and excitement. Unfortunately, enthusiasm doesn’t translate to success, as Pat has only made the playoffs 1 of 3 years. Maybe he figures it out soon. </p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/alex-normal.png" alt="Alex Sims" title="Alex Sims"/>

        <h2>Alex Sims</h2>

        <p>Founding member and 2019 champion. Alex is the taller, hairier, younger brother to Andrew. The biggest difference? Alex gets to wear his championship ring to family outings. Despite being very stubborn when it comes to trades, Alex is a yearly contender.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/andrew-normal.png" alt="Alex Sims" title="Alex Sims"/>

        <h2>Andrew Sims</h2>

        <p>Founding member. Despite being the eldest, Andrew is the runt of the litter in his family. His brother is taller, hairier, and better at fantasy football. Hopefully Andrew can add some parity to the sibling rivalry this season.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/grayson-normal.png" alt="Grayson Steele" title="Grayson Steele"/>

        <h2>Grayson Steele</h2>

        <p>Member as of 2020 and current champion. It’s not often that rookies have any success, let alone win the championship, and Grayson did just that on the back of Derrick Henry and Stefon Diggs. He looks like he will be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="manager-container">

        <img src="images/jordan-normal.png" alt="Jordan Stubblefield" title="Jordan Stubblefield"/>

        <h2>Jordan Stubblefield</h2>

        <p>Founding member and podcast guest. Stubbs, first name Jordan, has the highest all-time win % and number of wins with an overall record of 23-10. Much like Logan, he can never put it together come playoff time. Could this be the year? Probably not, but maybe.</p>
